# Supervised Learning

## Introduction / Development

## Code
It was mentioned often within the course discussion board and assignment description that code is not the emphasis of this assignment. That being said, I be brief in the description and design of the code written.

## Data Sets

### Adult [2]
The Adult data set was found on the UCI machine learning data sets library. This data set includes attributes of anonomyous U.S. citizens including marital status, occupation, age, location of residence, and other attributes with the objective being to predict whether the individual's occupational annual salary is greater than 50,000 dollars

This data set was chosen and deemed "interesting" because I was looking for a data set that contained both categorical variables (such as marital status, gender, occupation) and non-categorical variables (such as age, capital gains & losses).

<real world applicability of the data set here>

### Wine Quality [3]
The wine quality data set was also found on the UCI machine learning data sets library. This data set includes ~5000 samples of chemical characteristics of wine, as as pH level, concentrations of various acids, alcohol content, and more, with the objective being to predict the wine's quality (a measure between 0 and 10).

This data set was chosen and deemed "interesting" because 1. who doesn't like wine? and 2. the data contained within the set was entirely continuious, but produced a categorical/discrete output of rating. Additionally on first thought, I would deem wine quality a subjective trait measured and evaluated only by the snobbiest wine-o's. However, I was curious if there were any truth to the matter.

Unfortunately, this data set masked the brand and price of the wine tested, so an accurately trained model (artificial wine snob, if you will) cannot produce any direct real-world impacts.


## Classifiers


### Decision Tree


### Neural Network


### K-Nearest Neighbor


### Support Vector Machine


### Boosting
* From the course slack chat, it was recommended to use the AdaBoostedClassifier
