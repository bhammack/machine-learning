# Supervised Learning
**Project Analysis**


## Introduction / Development

## Code
It was mentioned often within the course discussion board and assignment description that code is not the emphasis of this assignment. That being said, I be brief in the description and design of the code written.

## Data Sets

### Iris [4]
The Iris data set was found and selected on the UCI machine learning data sets library. It is one of the most popular data sets used.

In terms of data characteristics, the set is described as "contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class referecs to a type of iris plant". This data set was selected for this assignment due to the following description that "one class is linearly separable from the other two, the latter of which are NOT linearly separaable from each other" [4]. Based on this notion that two of the classes were linearly married, I desired to run experiements of different models to learn and discover how to optimize when it is known beforehand that some of the data set is linearly inseparable.


### Adult [3]
The Adult data set was found and selected also on the UCI machine learning data sets library. This data set includes attributes of anonomyous U.S. citizens including marital status, occupation, age, location of residence, and other attributes with the objective being to predict whether the individual's occupational annual salary is greater than 50,000 dollars
